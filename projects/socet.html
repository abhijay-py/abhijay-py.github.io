                <p>This project is a research project in extending compressed instructions in a RISC-V core microcontroller.</p>
                <p>This research was conducted as a part of the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/SoC-Team" class="inline_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">System-on-Chip Extension Technology (SoCET) Team</a> at the Purdue University alongside Aniket Chatterjee.</p>
                <p>In microcontroller architecture, the ability to store more programs or more instructions allows for more
                    functionality and more complex programs to better operate on microcontrollers. We implemented the C, or
                    compressed instruction, extension in the RISC-V core, including some instructions that do not have 32-bit
                    equivalents, such as push and pop instructions as well as table jump instructions which fall under the Zcmp
                    and Zcmt subsets of the C extension. </p>
                <p> The new instructions added provide valuable utility to developers as the
                    push and pop instructions allow saving register values before and after a function call and table jump
                    instructions allow for things such as the creation of a vectored interrupt table for better interrupt handling in the
                    microcontroller. </p>
                <p> While other compressed instructions were simply implemented by converting them to their 32-
                    bit equivalents, these instructions had to be tackled differently as multiple 32-bit instructions were needed to
                    implement one 16-bit instruction. This was done by using a ROM to store a database of 32-bit instructions that
                    each of these new 16-bit instructions decode into and using a state machine to send the correct 32-bit
                    instructions while stalling the fetching of the next instruction until the 16-bit instruction has been fully
                    processed. </p>
                <p> To implement and verify that that the C extension works with the existing core, SystemVerilog was
                    used as the HDL and Verilator was used for simulation. Custom RISC-V assembly test cases were also written
                    to test and verify the new compressed instructions implemented operate as intended.</p>
